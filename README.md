## Abstract
OpenStreetMap (OSM) data consists of digitized geographic objects with semantic tags assigned by volunteer contributors. These human and machine readable tags are edited manually and automatically to improve data quality. The structure of the tags allow machine learning algorithms to support user editing by learning to identify irregular objects and data patterns. This research experimented with a random forest algorithm on geospatial variables for geospatial outlier detection and knowledge discovery in OSM data without ground-truth reference data.
